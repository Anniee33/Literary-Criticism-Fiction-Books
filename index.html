            <h1 class="firstbook">Feminist Criticism about “Make My Wish Come True” by Rachel Lippincott</h1>
            <p class="firstbookpara">
                Make My Wish Come True by Rachael Lippincott includes some ideas of the modern femininity problem connected with the identification of women’s personalities, their relations with 
                society, and their ability to be independent. The main characters in this story are Arden James and Caroline Beckett. In the novel, the changes tell the story of women’s relief 
                and women’s capacity to challenge the role expected of them by society within the workplace and in relationships. From this perspective, one of the most important topics for 
                analysis of the book is the way society perceives women, especially celebrities. 
            <p>Caroline Beckett’s Seven Basic Plot Points shows that women have it tough in the workplace. Caroline is a small town journalist who tries to have a good career even though she is 
                dealing with so much pressure being a woman. She responded and said, “It’s hard to be taken seriously in a room full of people who think you’re just here to fill a quota”. They 
                show that in many male-dominated fields, women face prejudice where their worth is constantly doubted. Caroline wants to be promoted for being deserving instead of being feminine, 
                which is a common feminist theme. She also struggles with a choice between a career and personal life when she will say, "Can I really have both, the career I want and the happiness 
                I deserve?”. This is about women’s duality and the excess pressure on them: they have to be career-oriented and happy but end up ill. </p>
                Another issue that can also be discussed in relation to the novel is the performance aspect that is characteristic of all people so that they could become acceptable for society. Both 
                Arden and Caroline experience this in one way or another, especially in the series where it is an entirely fake dating arrangement. After, Caroline says to herself, "We’re pretending, 
                but aren’t we all pretending in some way to fit into the world?". This line shows the range to which women direct into playing out the cultural roles assigned to them despite the fact 
                that they are suppressed beings. In the case of Arden and Caroline, fake dating represents the pressure to perform a role appropriate to the cultural narrative, which expects women to 
                act in harmony with that narrative rather than the reality they desire. 
            </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="additional-text">
            <p>
                Now, breaking with the stereotype of the romantic holiday, the novel presents the relationship between two women, focusing on the problem of representation of the strange community. 
                Caroline says, “I’ve spent so much time trying to convince myself that I couldn't fall in love with someone like you, but it was never my ability to love that was in question.” 
                It becomes relative based on what feels right to me.” This line refers to Caroline’s transformation of aspiration and a freedom-denying culture with regards to the concept of love and relationships. 
                It focuses on the message that people should be able to decide on their own or write the love story they please without limitations. Concerning the sapphic relationship, the story underlines the 
                importance of multiple representations and the right of women to love and happiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it was seen in the case of Arden and Caroline and their transformation throughout the story "Make My Wish Come True", it cancels out the stereotype of injustice on women in an attempt to meet societal expectations. 
                The relationships of women characters in the story demonstrate that a woman in present-day society, whether promoted to the theatre boss like Arden or pursuing a career like Caroline, must endure social demands as well 
                as their career ambitions. They are all aware of the early feminist movement, the inability to share an opinion and choices of one’s life, including happiness. The book proves that, despite the fact that the community sets 
                specific standards that women need to follow, women can fight these norms and build the lives they want and lead the careers they choose.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, "Make My Wish Come True" shows a strong female message about finding oneself, the need for emancipation from society’s rules, and steps toward it. 
                Both Arden’s attempt in the show at a process of regaining control of her life and Caroline S Beckett’s determinations of her career and family represent numerous modern women’s conflicts. 
                The novel is an evolution story for women and outlines that women can take charge of their lives regardless of all the limitations placed on them. Therefore, the book highlights aspects 
                of women’s self-identification, their choices, and happiness outside the enclosure of gender prejudices.

            <p class="secondbookpara">
                A curse that kills, lethal skin that lasts until. Juliette Ferrars as the protagonist of the young adult dystopian series book entitled Shatter me written by Tahereh 
            Mafi. Juliette was once a teenage girl but was rejected by the society of how deadly her lethal skin was. It was once at the convenience store when she was trying to 
            help a little boy, a 14 year old teenage girl— an innocent young girl who does not know what lies ahead of her. It was then the little boy screamed in agony once had 
            come in contact with Juliette’s skin. She had unalived the little boy accidentally, the torture in the little boy's scream hunts her until this day. With the 
            unspecified cause of the case of Juliette Ferrars spread towards her surroundings in just an hour, minute, into seconds. After that, she had been forsaken by her own 
            parents. Shooing her away and saying that she is some kind of a curse that was brought into this world. The society murmured. So suddenly, she is like a landmine that 
            is buried, like the concentration camp when imprisoned, she had become the embodiment of certain death. The story change where the protagonist was given to the scientists
            willingly by her parents which she truly despises. Word for word, day by day. Multiple tests Juliette had lived through. She was once a 14 year old child— innocent and 
            pure and was then forced to be a 17 year old teenager, her youth was taken under test and trials, to be able to know the cause of being unnatural. 264 days Juliette was 
            locked up, in a prison-like cell. The four white walls she could recall, the cracks in every corner of the room is where a spider crawls. In the asylum she had been in, with no 
            human contact. She was at the edge of losing her sanity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As stated, the protagonist had experienced being rejected by the society. The relationship between the protagonist and the society is that Juliette had difficulties 
            because one incident led her life to be manipulated by the Reestablishment or the researchers. Full of rejection and fear is how the society views this character 
            Juliette Ferras. Because of her having the unknown curse within her that she cannot control, people in the sector 45 avoid and fear her, making her feel not a part of 
            the whole or an outcast. The book does not explore most of the protagonist's past but it is mostly about how the society is telling her to act as a normal being in 
            order for her
            </p>
            <p>
                to feel accepted and was kept away from the open world. The narrative draw attention on how the story is more on the feeling of the character being locked
                away from the outside world in order for researchers to not only control her life but to also use her as a weapon for the military purposes. Her in the insane asylum 
                brings up a psychological process where her ability to be free, to greatly communicate with the others, and live her  teenage life was prohibited in a way where her 
                youth was taken away from her because of how society is prejudiced towards individuals who are different.
                </p>
                <p>Only then, having a pen and paper beside Juliette helped her keep sane. She wrote daily, and the book gives the reader a view of her diary chapter by chapter. Soon, the story turned upside down once the antagonist named Warner sent a soldier to bring Juliette into their sector, the sector 45.  Adam Kent is the soldiers' name. He was the character who captured the heart of Juliette which led to them having a relationship without the commander knowing that a soldier of his had fallen in love within duty. On the other hand, the book focused on how Juliette Ferrars will be able to control her curse. To prevent the antagonist from using her as a weapon. To turn her curse into power.

                <i>“Loneliness is a strange sort of thing.
                It creeps up on you, quiet and still, sits by your side in the dark, strokes your hair as you sleep. It wraps itself around your bones, squeezing so tight you almost can't breathe. It leaves lies in your heart, lies next to you at night, leaches the light out from every corner. It's a constant companion, clasping your hand only to yank you down when you're struggling to stand up.
                <br>
                You wake up in the morning and wonder who you are. You fail to fall asleep at night and tremble in your skin. You doubt you doubt you doubt
                <br>
                do I
                <br>
                don't I
                <br>
                should I
                <br>
                why won't I <br>
                And even when you're ready to let go. When you're ready to break free. When you're ready to be brand-new. Loneliness is an old friend standing beside you in the mirror, looking you in the eye, challenging you to live your life without it. You can't find the words to fight yourself, to fight the words screaming that you're not enough never enough never ever enough.
                Loneliness is a bitter, wretched companion. Sometimes it just won't let go.”

                Reading this, the story was more in a prose-poetic form as it focused more in the diary of Juliette in the cell. Stream of consciousness is applied as it views the thought of the protagonist vividly. Mafi’s poetic language gives a summary of Juliette’s various internal struggles, and is a beautiful writing style that would however, likely resonate with readers who have ever been made to feel like an outcast. At times, the narrative focuses more around the feeling than context, resulting in pretty much every reasoning behind the societal structure or motives of the Reestablishment are not clearly stated so, this allows the readers to make their own interpretation of the story or how the story will go after another chapter. At the same time, the diary did bring out her consciousness but sometimes there was the risk of flatness and slowing the flow of the plot.
